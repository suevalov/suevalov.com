I want to share [one small app](https://sindresorhus.com/lungo) that I find particularly useful for me. There are
some situations during the day when I need to be sure that my Mac won't sleep or lower the brightness of the screen. 

There are my use cases:

* Compiling Chromium, which I do approximately once in a week, by staying my laptop overnight.
* Doing a presentation.
* Learning German and having a textbook with exercises open on my Mac.
* Watching videos in non-fullscreen mode.

Going to <span class="highlight">`System Preferences -> Energy Saver`</span> and changing it every time doesn't seem productive to me.

And here comes [Lungo](https://sindresorhus.com/lungo):

Dead simple app. In two clicks you can stop your Mac from falling asleep for a definite or indefinite period of time.

Super convenient! Thanks to [@sindresorhus](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus).
