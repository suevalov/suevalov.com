What is [Setapp]? First of all, it's a product I fell in love with from the very first day of using it and I'm really keen to share it with you.

[Setapp] is a subscription service that is making a revolution in apps distribution on macOS. Instead of buying each application separately, you just pay a fixed amount of money each month as a subscription fee and get a huge list of apps available for download and use anytime you want.

At the moment of writing this article they have 107 apps on the platform and the number constantly grows.
