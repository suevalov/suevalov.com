Programming world evolves extremely quick and it's impossible to track all the news and be up to date with all technologies. We have to narrow down and pick carefully.

I have picked a number of technologies I want to learn in 2018 and I'd like to share the list with you and try to explain why I did this choice.

## ReasonML

During the last several years I have barely used JavaScript without types. The web development became too complicated and in order to keep sanity, I prefer to give as much responsibility to the machine as possible. [Flow](https://flow.org/) by Facebook and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) by Microsoft are excellent solutions that helped me and my teams to write more sound and maintainable code.

The next big thing might be [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/). It's not a new language, it's a new syntax and really powerful toolchain by the battle-tested language, OCaml. The syntax is really easy to pick up if you're JavaScript developer. Reason can be compiled to JavaScript using [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/). Consider it as solidly statically typed, faster and simpler cousin of JavaScript.

## Kotlin

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a new official language for Android platform, statically typed and seamlessly interoperable with Java.

- Approximately 40% fewer lines of code compared to Java
- Easy to learn especially if you know Java.
- Avoids errors such as null exceptions

The good thing about Kotlin is that if you already have started a project in Java, no need to worry
as you can use Kotlin syntax in existing Java code and it will work perfectly.

## Apollo

[Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) allows to build GraphQL API on top of your existing REST APIs. It is a family of technologies you can incrementally add to your stack: Apollo Client to connect data to your UI, Apollo Engine for infrastructure and tooling, and Apollo Server to translate your REST API and backends into a GraphQL schema.

- Eliminates boilerplate.

- You can put computed fields, data transformations, and security logic into your API so your front-ends don't have to reimplement them every time.

- Add fields to GraphQL as you go and deprecate old fields when you no longer need them. Mock some or all of your API and build the front-end in parallel.

- Fetch exactly data you need, no more and no less. Improve performance with GraphQL specific caching and optimizations across the stack.

## Cypress

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a complete solution for end-to-end testing. Writing E2E tests with Selenium based technologies always was a pain and Cypress seems to be a game changer that simplifies it a lot. Totally worth to give it a go.
