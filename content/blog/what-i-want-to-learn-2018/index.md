Programming world evolves extremly quick and it's impossible to track all the news and be up to date with all technologies. We have to narrow down and pick carefully.

I have picked a number of technologies I want to learn in 2018 and I'd like to share the list with you and try to explain why I did this choice.

## ReasonML

During the last several years I have barely used JavaScript without types. The web development became too complicated and in order to keep sanity I prefer to give as much responsibity to the machine as possible. [Flow](https://flow.org/) by Facebook and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) by Microsoft are excellent solutions that helped my and my teams to write more sound and maintainable code.

The next big thing might be [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/). It's not a new language, it's a new syntax and really powerfool toolchain by the battle-tested language, OCaml. The syntax is really easy to pick up if you're JavaScript developer. Reason can be compiled to JavaScript using [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/). Consider it as solidly statically typed, faster and simpler cousin of JavaScript.

## Kotlin

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is new official language for Android platform, statically typed and seamlessly interoperable with Java.

* Approximately 40% less lines of code compared to Java
* Easy to learn especially if you know Java.
* Avoids errors such as null exceptions

## Apollo

[Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) allows use to build GraphQL API on top of your existing REST APIs, so you can ship new application features fast without waiting on backend changes.

## Cypress

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a complete solution for end-to-end testing.
