I want to share [one small app](https://sindresorhus.com/lungo) that I find particularly useful for me. There are some situations during the day when I need to be sure that my Mac won't sleep or lower the brightness of the screen.

Here are my use cases:

- Compiling Chromium, which I do approximately once a week, by leaving my laptop on overnight.
- Doing a presentation.
- Learning German and having a textbook with exercises open on my Mac.
- Watching videos in non-fullscreen mode.

Going to `System Preferences -> Energy Saver` and changing it every time doesn't seem productive to me.

And here comes [Lungo](https://sindresorhus.com/lungo):

Dead simple app. In two clicks, you can prevent your Mac from falling asleep for a definite or indefinite period of time.

Super convenient! Thanks to [@sindresorhus](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus).
